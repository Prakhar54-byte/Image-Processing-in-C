# Image Processing in C

## Overview

This project aims to apply various image filters and transformations to BMP images using C programming language. The filters include black and white conversion, RGB to grayscale conversion, brightness adjustment, image blurring, color inversion, and image rotation.

## Features

- **Black to White:** Converts the image to black and white based on a threshold.
- **RGB to Gray:** Converts the image to grayscale using the luminosity method.
- **Increase Brightness:** Increases the brightness of the image.
- **Blur the Image:** Applies a blur filter to the image.
- **Blur to Gray:** Blurs the image and then converts it to grayscale.
- **Colours to Sepia:** Converts the image to sepia tones.
- **Copy Image:** Simply copies the image without any modification.
- **Darken Image:** Darkens the image by reducing pixel values.
- **Rotate Image:** Rotates the image by 90 degrees left, right, or 180 degrees.
- **Negative Image:** Generates the negative of the image.

## Requirements

- C compiler (gcc recommended)
- BMP image files for testing

## Usage

1. **Compile the Code**
    ```bash
    gcc MAjor_Project.c -o image_processing
    ```

2. **Run the Program**
    ```bash
    ./image_processing
    ```

3. **Choose a Filter**
    - Follow the on-screen menu to select a filter.
    - Provide the input BMP file name when prompted.
    - The processed image will be saved with a default name or as specified in the code.
